# What is this

Simple tool for adding/removing hyphens when copying raw16 uuids from Oracle to proper uuids, as I got quickly bored doing it manually.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and thus depends on an impressive 2.4 million lines of javascript, as counted by cloc, to function.

Currently hosted on https://uuid.tafl.no
